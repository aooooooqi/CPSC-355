Nice work!

Excellent work. You lost one point because your comments were 
a little messy and you technically wrote a post test (instead of a pre test) loop.
A3:100/100
Excellent work! Just a note, technically "random" is non standard C, 
but is commonly provided by various C libraries (including glibc, 
the C library we are using in this class). 
So to be "fully" correct you should have written bl rand (instead of bl random). Very minor detail however.

You were allocating too much space in some of your subroutines. 
Any subroutine that has no local variables only needs 16 bytes for the frame record, 
and something like equal only needs 20 bytes for the  frame record + 4 byte local variable, -1 point.
You did use a local variable on the stack for "result" inside the equal function, -2 points.
A5:87/100
-5 points: incorrect usage of calle-saved registers in part A.
-3 points: no range checking for input arguments in part B.
